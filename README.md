# SMART DUSTBIN -- REALTIME

The Smart Dustbin uses ultrasonic sensors to sense when someone is near, automatically opening its lid for touch-free waste disposal. This makes throwing away trash more hygienic and easy.

The dustbin is connected to Telegram, sending alerts when it is full so that it can be emptied promptly. This helps keep the area clean and ensures waste is managed efficiently.

The Smart Dustbin also serves as a communication hub, sharing information and updates to help build a stronger community.
